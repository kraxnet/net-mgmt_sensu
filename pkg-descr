Sensu is often described as the "monitoring router". Most simply put, 
Sensu connects "check" scripts run across many nodes with "handler" 
scripts run on one or more Sensu servers. Checks are used, for example,
to determine if Apache is up or down. Checks can also be used to collect
metrics (such as MySQL or Apache statistics). The output of checks is
routed to one or more handlers. Handlers determine what to do with the
results of checks. Handlers currently exist for sending alerts via email,
as well as to various external services such as Pagerduty, IRC, Twitter,
etc. Handlers can also feed metrics into Graphite, Librato, etc. Writing
checks and handlers is quite simple and can be done in any language.
